## 🌋 About the Mod

**Thermal Shock** is a resource-generation mod designed for Skyblock gameplay. It introduces a specialized thermal-management system, allowing players to automate material conversion by managing heat and cold inputs within custom structures.

### Key Features
*   **Simulation Chamber:** A configurable multiblock structure (up to 13x13) that supports physical block/entity scanning or high-speed virtualization.
*   **Dual Processing Modes:**
    *   **Overheating:** Focuses on high heat-rate accumulation for smelting and material restructuring.
    *   **Thermal Shock:** Focuses on the differential (ΔT) between high and low temperatures to shatter and refine materials.
*   **Material Clump:** A unique data-driven item that acts as a carrier for output results and processing requirements.
*   **Thermal Converter:** A compact machine for straightforward item and fluid conversions based on temperature thresholds.
*   **Native KubeJS Support:** Fully integrated with KubeJS. See the [KubeJS Integration Guide](./wiki/KubeJS-Integration.md) for details.

## 🛠️ Requirements
*   **Minecraft:** 1.21.1
*   **NeoForge:** 21.1.x+
*   **Dependencies:** KubeJS (Optional, for recipe customization)
